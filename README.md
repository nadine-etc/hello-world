My first program on GitHub. Let the initiation begin! 

Hello! 
I am a student that only has one semester of experiewnce programming but so far I really enjoy it. So far I am proficient in C. I am currently taking C++ and Java courses at my college and teaching myself JS via codecadaemy and online tutorials for a club project. Side note, I love soccer (futbol), animals, math, reading, alternative and indie music.
